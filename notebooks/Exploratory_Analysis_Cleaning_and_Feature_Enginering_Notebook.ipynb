The findings may be interesting in their own right, or they can be used to inform our modeling choices, such as by helping us decide which features to use."

    "#### Function Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function:** `analyze_missing_values_and_columns_description`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose:** \n",
    "- To analyze missing values across all CSV files in the input folder.\n",
    "- To provide detailed descriptions of the columns in these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- **input_folder (str):** The path to the folder containing the CSV files to be analyzed.\n",
    "- **output_folder (str):** The path to the folder where the analysis reports will be saved.\n",
    "- **columns_description_file (str):** The path to the file containing descriptions of the columns.\n",
    "- **main_file (str):** The main CSV file to focus the analysis on.\n",
    "- **files_with_target (list, optional):** A list of files that include a target column for focused analysis.\n",
    "- **target_column (str, optional):** The name of the target column to analyze, if applicable.\n",
    "- **analyze_columns (list, optional):** Specific columns to analyze in detail.\n",
    "- **extract_columns (list, optional):** Specific columns to extract for the analysis.\n",
    "- **testing (bool, optional):** If enabled, limits the analysis to a subset of rows for quick testing.\n",
    "- **max_rows (int, optional):** Maximum number of rows to analyze in testing mode (default is 1000).\n",
    "- **exclude_files (list, optional):** A list of files to exclude from the analysis.\n",
    "- **testing_output_folder (str, optional):** The folder to store testing data outputs.\n",
    "- **chunksize (int, optional):** The number of rows to process at a time, useful for handling large files (default is 50,000).\n",
    "\n",
    "By running this function, we obtain a comprehensive overview of the dataset, including the extent and distribution of missing values, and detailed descriptions of each column. This information is critical for understanding data quality and preparing for further data processing and analysis."

    "2. **Columns Specification:**\n",
    "   - **Analyze Columns:** A list of columns to be analyzed in detail.\n",
    "   - **Extract Columns:** A list of columns to be extracted for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing Mode:**\n",
    "   - **Testing:** If enabled, the analysis is limited to a specified number of rows for quick testing.\n",
    "   - **Max Lines:** The maximum number of rows to analyze when in testing mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **File Exclusions:**\n",
    "   - **Exclude Files:** A list of files to be excluded from the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Testing Output Subfolder:**\n",
    "   - **Testing Output Subfolder:** The name of the subfolder where test data will be stored when in testing mode.\n",

This is a crucial step for data cleaning, as it standardizes missing entries, allowing us to apply various imputation techniques or handle them appropriately in subsequent analysis.\n",

    "1. **Identifying Empty Values:** We scan the dataset to locate cells that are empty or contain placeholder values indicating missing data.\n",

    "### Columns Types Verification\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we verify and analyze the data types of columns in CSV files, logging detailed type summaries and ensuring proper data type conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logging Configuration:**\n",
    "   - Set up logging to record data processing activities and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Analyze Chunk Types:**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `analyze_chunk_types(chunk)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Analyzes the data types of each column in a chunk of the CSV file.\n",
    "   - **Method:** Iterates over columns, detects data types, and calculates the proportion of each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Detect Data Type:**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `detect_type(value)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Identifies the type of a given value (e.g., integer, float, datetime, boolean, string).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Merge and Normalize Type Summaries:**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `merge_type_summaries(main_summary, chunk_summary)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Merges type summaries from multiple chunks into a main summary.\n",
    "   - **Function:** `normalize_type_summaries(type_summary, total_chunks)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Normalizes the type summaries by the number of chunks processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display and Save Type Summaries:**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `display_type_summary(file_name, type_summary)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Logs the type summary for each column.\n",
    "   - **Function:** `save_type_summary_report(file_name, type_summary)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Saves the type summary report to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Convert Column Types:**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `convert_column_types(data, type_summary, identifier_columns)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Converts columns to their most frequent data type, handling special cases for identifier columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Generate and Save Reports:**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `generate_report(file_name, type_summary_before, type_summary_after)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Generates a detailed report of column types before and after conversion.\n",
    "   - **Function:** `save_type_summary_report(file_name, type_summary)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Saves the type summary report to a specified file.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Load and Preprocess DataFrames:**\n",
    "   - **Function:** `load_and_preprocess_dataframes(...)`\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Loads CSV files, processes them in chunks, replaces placeholders for missing values, normalizes type summaries, and saves the corrected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this structured approach, we ensure that all columns have consistent and appropriate data types, facilitating accurate analysis and further processing."

    "In this section, we focus on handling missing data through various imputation techniques. This process ensures that our datasets are complete and ready for analysis by filling in missing values systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Column Types Management:**\n",
    "   - **save_column_types(df):** Saves the original data types of columns.\n",
    "   - **restore_column_types(df, column_types):** Restores the data types of columns after processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation for Imputation:**\n",
    "   - **prepare_data_for_imputation(df, logger, exclude_columns, missing_threshold, extreme_value_threshold, small_value_threshold, round_decimals):**\n",
    "     - Prepares the data by handling missing values, capping extreme values, ensuring uniform data types, and logging key steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Impute and Save DataFrames:**\n",
    "   - **impute_and_save_dataframes_from_folder(input_folder, imputations, exclude_columns, chunk_size, output_folder, clean_memory, testing, max_rows, testing_data_sub_folder, round_decimals, log_level, export_logs, log_folder_path):**\n",
    "     - Processes each CSV file in the input folder.\n",
    "     - Applies various imputation methods to handle missing data.\n",
    "     - Logs the progress and results.\n",
    "     - Saves the imputed data to the output folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Imputation Techniques:**\n",
    "   - A list of imputation strategies including median, mean, most frequent, constant, KNN, iterative, forward fill (ffill), and backward fill (bfill).\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this structured approach, we ensure that our datasets are free of missing values, which enhances the quality and reliability of subsequent analyses. The logger provides detailed insights and traceability for the entire imputation process, while the various imputation techniques offer flexibility to handle different types of missing data scenarios."

    "## Polynomial Features\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple feature construction method is called [polynomial features](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html). In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` and `EXT_SOURCE_2^2` and also variables such as `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1` x `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, `EXT_SOURCE_1^2` x   `EXT_SOURCE_2^2`, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called [interaction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics) because they  capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves  may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. [Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/interpreting-interactions-in-regression/) to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jake VanderPlas writes about [polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.04-feature-engineering.html) for those who want more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we create polynomial features using the `EXT_SOURCE` variables and the `DAYS_BIRTH` variable. [Scikit-Learn has a useful class called `PolynomialFeatures`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures.html) that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into [problems with overfitting](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_underfitting_overfitting.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-underfitting-overfitting-py))."
